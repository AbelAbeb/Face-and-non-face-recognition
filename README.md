## Introduction
This project is a machine learning model for face and non-face recognition. It uses various techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and different classifiers to distinguish between images of faces and non-faces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of Python.
- You have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts.
- You have the necessary Python libraries installed. These include `os`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `PIL`, `sklearn`.

### Installation
Clone the GitHub repository and navigate to the cloned project in your terminal. Then, run the Python script.

## Usage
This project can be used to recognize faces and non-faces in images. The model is trained on a dataset of face and non-face images, and it can predict whether a new image is a face or not.

The code includes functions for loading and preprocessing the images, splitting the data into training and testing sets, applying PCA and LDA, and training and evaluating different classifiers.
